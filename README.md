# Credit Score Analysis

## Data
- Credit score data set with 28 columns was sourced from kaggle.

## Proposed findings and a hypothesis of results
Credit scores are a universal metric, used by companies and individuals alike, in various areas of life to make decisions. With this dataset, we hope to perform a deep learning classification analysis of the data to determine whether we can predict if an individual will have a good or bad credit score based on the input features provided.

## Machine Learning Model
As also visualized in the Data_pipeline.png flowchart in the Resourcecs/ folder, we will create a supervised deep learning model to classify the individuals in into 2 groups: 
- Good credit, and
- Bad credit
