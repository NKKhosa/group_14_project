# Credit Score Analysis

## Data
- Credit score data set with 28 columns was sourced from kaggle.
- Data is divided further into smaller sets inorder to accomplish better results.
- Using this metadata we will generate our hypothesis and by using that we will acieve our conclusions. 

## Proposed findings and a hypothesis of results
Credit scores are a universal metric, used by companies and individuals alike, in various areas of life to make decisions. With this dataset, we hope to perform a deep learning classification analysis of the data to determine whether we can predict if an individual will have a good or bad credit score based on the input features provided.

A credit score can considerably influence your economic existence. It plays a key function in a lender's decision to offer you credit. People accompanying credit scores beneath 640, e.g., are mainly deliberate expected subprime borrowers. Lending organizations frequently charge interest on subprime mortgages at a rate above a unoriginal mortgage to offset themselves from bearing more risk. They grant permissions like demanding a smaller compensation term or a co-signer for borrowers accompanying a low credit score.

## Machine Learning Model
As also visualized in the Data_pipeline.png flowchart in the Resourcecs/ folder, we will create a supervised deep learning model to classify the individuals in into 2 groups: 
- Good credit, and
- Bad credit

### Input Features
- Month 
- Age 
- Occupation 
- Annual_Income
- Monthly_InHand_Salary
- Num_Bank_Accounts

- Outstanding_Debt
- Credit_Utilization_Ratio
- Credit_History_Age
- Payment_of_Min_Amount
- Total_EMI_per_month
- Amount_invested_monthly 
- Payment_Behaviour
- Monthly_Balance

### Output 
- Credit_Score

## Additional research approach:

Further more we will attempt to evaluate how likely the customer will get the approval of the loan on the basis credit score.
